				Genetic Engineering (GE) is a highly complicated and advanced branch of science which involves a wide range of techniques used in changing 
				the genetic material in the DNA code in a living organism. 'Genetic Engineering' means the deliberate modification of the characters of an
				organism by the manipulation of its genetic material. Genetic engineering comes under the broad heading of Biotechnology. There is a great
				scope in this field as the demand for genetic engineers are growing in India as well as abroad.

				<h4>Eligibility &  criteria requirements</h4><br>
				<ul><!--Degree requirements-->
					<li>The basic eligibility criteria for a graduate degree (BE / B.Tech) is 10+2 or equivalent examination, with Biology, Chemistry 
					and Mathematics as well as genetics as part of biology.</li><br>
					<li>A qualified genetic engineer, must have a graduate / postgraduate degree in genetics or related fields such as biotechnology,
					molecular biology, microbiology or biochemistry OR a doctorate (PhD) from a recognised university, based on 2-3 years of his own 
					research under the guidance of a professor/lecturer.</li><br>
					<li>Most institutes do not offer courses in Genetic Engineering as a special discipline but as a subsidiary in biotechnology, 
					microbiology, biochemistry streams. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Biotechnology offer specialisation in genetic engineering.</li><br>
