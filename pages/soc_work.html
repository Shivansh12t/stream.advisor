				Social workers are the helping hands for needy people who are suffering from homelessness, poverty, violence, abuses and diseases
				like cancer, AIDS etc. They work towards the solutions of people's social, economic and emotional problems through counseling,
				arranging conferences, increasing resources, spreading public awareness and starting social programs and health services. The area
				of service for a social worker is wide, which can range from working in various developmental projects of the government to working
				for NGOs. The work of a social worker can be related to an educational programme, health, environment or forest and water management.
				It is the duty of the social worker to answer their client's specific needs and to do the follow up for providing apt service to them.

               As a practical oriented course, Social Work deals with the study of methods and techniques used in developmental activities. Emerging
			   in the 19th century, it has now become a major career choice with the increasing number of social organizations.
