				Audio engineering, a branch of Audio science, is a career for those who love music and wish to be a part of this industry. Audio 
				Engineering is all about capturing sound, recording, copying, and editing, mixing and reproducing sound using electronic and
				mechanical devices. It involves both production and post-production tasks. Those who have studied any course in audiography and 
				sound recording can become an audio engineer. They are responsible for the final sound that we hear in music, i.e. in songs,
				background scores in videos, films, advertisements and so on.
