				Food critic or food writer is a broad term used to describe a writer who explores food or restaurants and then publishes the results
				of their findings. Those who share their opinions via food columns in newspapers and magazines are known as food columnists. A food
				writer/critic is a person who has a strong understanding and taste for good food combined with excellent writing and editing skills. 
				Food critics write about restaurants, ranging from fast food establishments to high end exclusive restaurants, cafes, shops, food 
				manufacturer or other food outlets. They provide thoughtful, descriptive and unbiased information to the public. Critics visit these 
				food joints, taste their special dishes and then make their opinions known to public by publishing them in paper/magazine, Internet,
				TV or radio. These days, the internet is becoming more important in forming opinions.
