				Over the years with the great expansion of scientific knowledge, the basis of applying science particularly chemistry to develop
				technology has increased tremendously. This has led to the development of the profession of chemical Engineering. Chemical Engineering 
				involves the design and maintenance of chemical plants and the development of chemical processes for converting raw materials or chemicals
				into valuable forms including those to remove chemicals from waste materials, to enable large-scale manufacture. It combines knowledge of 
				Chemistry and Engineering for the production of chemicals and related by-products. 
				<br><br>
				The work of Chemical Engineers, the most versatile of all engineers, involves the invention, development, design, operation and 
				management of processes in industries. So they combine the work of several fields such as those of chemists, industrial engineers, 
				materials engineers as well as electrical engineers.
