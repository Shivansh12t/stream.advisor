				Mechanical engineering, the broadest of all Engineering disciplines deals with design and production of tools, machines and all other
				mechanical equipment to be used in industries. Mechanical engineering is concerned with all types of machinery in industries and all
				aspects of their mechanism and functioning; the design, development, construction, production, installation, operation and maintenance; 
				such as large steam and gas turbines, components of thermal power stations, internal combustion engines, jet engines, machine tools, air 
				conditioning and heating machines, refrigerators etc. to name a few. They not only design and create new products, but also develop 
				materials for them and ways of making them. In a way, mechanical engineers are involved in creating the future. They are the driving 
				force behind many of our technologies and industrial processes including innovative products like mobiles, PCs and DVD etc. in our modern
				world. The work of a Mechanical Engineer can be extremely challenging and fulfilling, requiring IT, design and analytical skills together
				with an ability to work as a team.
