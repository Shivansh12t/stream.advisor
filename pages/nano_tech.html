				Nanotechnology - the science of the miniature, and the technology of the future - is one of the most exciting and wide area of research which may lead to the greatest technological advances of 
				the 21st century. Nanotechnology is a unique and special branch of science that essentially combines physics, chemistry, biology, 
				engineering etc. Sometimes known as molecular manufacturing, it deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic 
				circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. The application of Nanotechnology will open new avenues of 
				research in the world of science and engineering in almost every field, from medicine to fabrics. Due to this, the relatively new field 
				is fast emerging as the favorite of all kinds of technological arena and will be one of the most significant enabling technologies in 
				the future. 
				<br><br>
				In India, Nanotechnology is at its infancy stage and is targeted towards the main streams like electronics, healthcare markets, and other 
				industrial products. Many scientific institutions have been doing Research and Development (R&D) in this field. The scope and application 
				of Nanotechnology is tremendous and mind-boggling and it is one of the hottest career option available to Indian Engineering graduates.
