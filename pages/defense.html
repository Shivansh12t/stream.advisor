                <h4>How to go about joining the Defense Services?</h4><br>			
				<ul><!--College options-->
					<li>A student finishing 12th who wishes to join the Indian Defense Services has to appear for the NDA (National Defense Academy)
					exam. NDA provides world class training facilities which include a graduation in science/humanities stream from JNU.</li><br>
                    <li>A student finishing plus two examinations can now opt for an engineering career in the Army or Navy through Technical Entry 
					Scheme, which enables him to become an engineer at Army expense before getting commissioned as an officer.</li><br>
                    <li>A graduate can join through the Combined Defense Services examination as a regular/short service commissioned officer. Training
					for regular commissioned officers is carried out at Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, known as the cradle of Military leadership.
					Those desirous of joining the Short Service Commission get trained at Officer’s Training Academy at Chennai and serve for a period
					of five years. On completion of this term he can either resign or opt for an extension for five years or a permanent commission.</li><br>
                    <li>Engineering graduates can join in the pre-final or that final year through the University Entry Scheme or after completion of 
					graduation through Technical Graduate Scheme without any written examination, by appearing before the Service Selection Board. In both 
					the cases the candidate gets an ante-date seniority of two years and gets commissioned as a captain.</li><br>
                    <li>Women’s entry at graduate, post graduate or an engineering graduate level has been very popular and competitive. A woman
					officer now gets to serve up to fourteen years after being trained at OTA, Chennai. Entry is based on selection by the Services 
					Selection Board. Women officers have performed well in all spheres with their male counterparts even under field conditions.</li><br>
                    <li>The Armed Forces have, over the time systematically focused on making the services more attractive, which include faster 
					promotions, improved accommodation availability and quality schooling for children. The modernistic equipment profile in the 
					services is highly challenging as well as exciting.</li><br>
