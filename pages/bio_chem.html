				Biochemistry is the study of the structure, composition and chemical reactions of substances in living organisms. It is an interdisciplinary program
				in which the principles of chemistry, biology, genetics, mathematics and physics is applied to the study or investigations of biomolecules,
				atoms, organelles, cells, tissues and organisms. Biochemistry is often defined as the 'chemistry of life' because it aims to explore and 
				understand aspects of life. Course for those who opt for biochemistry for higher education includes bioorganic chemistry, biophysical
				chemistry, human physiology, microbiology and virology, basic immunology, enzymology, intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates, structural
				biology, bioenergetics and biomembrances, computer applications in biology, nutritional and clinical biochemistry and molecular biology.
				Career prospects include primarily research based profiles.
