				When we hear the word 'hackers' a fear comes to us. But 'ethical hackers' also known as a 'white hat' is our friend. An ethical hacker 
				is someone who hacks with legal permission to strengthen systems and makes them penetrationproof. Ethical hacker is a network or computer 
				experts who help in finding loopholes in an IT system to seek vulnerabilities if any, so that the system remains safe from any malicious 
				hacker. Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing or red teaming is used to find loopholes in an IT system and 
				break into it.

				Ethical Hackers are technically skilled IT professionals with a strong desire to solve problems and prevent malicious hackers from 
				causing damage to network systems. Ethical hackers are well versed in computer and networking algorithms. They report the loopholes in 
				the security system to the owners and provide solutions to protect the network. In other words, ethical hackers try to penetrate networks,
				detect the vulnerabilities in the security systems and fix them before any troubleshooter can take advantage of it. An ethical hacker 
				is generally appointed by huge corporate companies to ensure the safety and privacy of their data. Computer security is a global issue 
				and it's the job of an ethical hacker to make the cyber space safe, now and forever.
