				Graphic Design is the process of visual communication which combines words, images and ideas to present the information to the audience. 
				Graphic Design in simple words, deals with aesthetically creating visual designs with the aid of computer to convey a message to the viewers.
				Graphic Designers may work in their own offices	or studios or in clients' offices. Graphic designers employed by large advertising, 
				publishing, or design firms generally work regular hours in well-lighted and comfortable settings. Designers in smaller design consulting 
				firms and those who freelance generally work on a contract, or job basis. Selfemployed designers work longer hours or shorter hours according
				to their convenience and based on the work undertaken or scheduled time.
