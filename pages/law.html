				Legal profession is one of the growing and lucrative professions all over the world. Lawyers counsel clients about their legal 
				rights and suggest course of action in a particular matter. They also advise clients and draw up legal documents, such as wills
				and contracts and conduct negotiations on legal matters, and may represent clients in court and tribunal proceedings. There are 
				various areas of specialisation in this field which one can choose from like corporation law, civil law, criminal law, international
				law, labour law, patent law, tax law and so on. However, some rapidly emerging fields in law are:
                <br><br>
				Corporate law: Also known as business law, enterprise law, or company law, this is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and
				conduct of persons, companies, organisations and businesses.Most corporate lawyers work for a corporation, but some are self-employed or
				work for a law firm. Some law school graduates become educators, investment bankers or leaders of non-profit organisations.
                <br><br>
				Cyber law: This is the area of law that deals with the Internet’s relationship to technological and electronic elements, including 
				computers, software, hardware and information systems (IS). Its core objective is to prevent or to minimise large scale damage
                from cybercriminal activities such as cyber terrorism, IPR violations, Credit card frauds, EFT frauds, and pornography.
                <br><br>
                Space law: This is the body of law that deals in agreements and treaties that govern outer space. It is much like general international
				law, which comprises a variety of international conventions, and United Nations General Assembly resolutions, as well as rules and 
				regulations of international organisations.
