				Most of us love to play games and spend hours on end playing them, be it on computer, mobile or video. Making a video game is just 
				not easy as playing a game. Designing a game is a long, multifaceted process which involves the combined effort of a team of 
				professionals with a unique mixture of creative and technical skills. It is one of the most complex parts of software development
				which involves various aspects of development of the game like- outlining the concept, documenting rules and principles, development
				of graphics and so on.
