				Forensic science is primarily concerned with the application of scientific principles for the investigation of crime. Using the very 
				latest in technology, forensic scientists convert the clues collected from a crime scene into evidence admissible in a court of law. 
				It is the use or application of science in courts or legal proceedings. This is a challenging and interesting field for those who have 
				are inquisitive and love adventure.

				into three; Medical, laboratory and field science:

				odontology (dentistry).
				<br><br>
				-> Laboratory sciences include chemistry, biology, toxicology, ballistics, fingerprints, questioned documents and marks and impressions.
