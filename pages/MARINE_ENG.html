				Marine engineering is a branch of Engineering that deals with nautical architecture and science. The term 'Marine Engineering' is meant
				for research conducted in oceans and coastal or inland waters connected to the sea. Marine Engineering courses deal with construction and 
				maintenance of ships and other sailing vessels. The three professions, i.e Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering and Ocean Engineering 
				are interrelated and sometimes may be confusing. 
				<br><br>
				Naval Architects are those who are involved with basic ship design, starting with hull forms and overall arrangements, power requirements,
				structure and stability. Ocean Engineers study the ocean environment to determine its effects on ships and other marine vehicles and 
				structures. They may design and operate stationary ocean platforms, or manned or remote-operated sub-surface vehicles used for deep sea 
				exploration.
