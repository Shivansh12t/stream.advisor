				Internet of Things, more popularly known as IoT, is a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical devices being 
				connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices. It is a virtual network of any type of objects embedded 
				with electronics, software, sensors, actuators and network connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. Internet
				of Things can connect devices embedded in various systems to the internet. When devices/ objects can represent themselves digitally, they 
				can be controlled from anywhere.The 'thing' in IoT could be a person with a heart monitor or an automobile with built-in-sensors or a 
				connected security system, electronic appliances, lights in household and commercial environments, alarm clocks, speaker systems, vending 
				machines and more. The concept of IoT explains that how internet and technology are changing the world and their impact on our lives. Most
				of the IoT devices donâ€™t need any human intervention: they can self-maintain, self-propel and self-drive.
