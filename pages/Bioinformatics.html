				Bioinformatics or computational biology is the use of information technology in the field of molecular biology, or the application of
                computer technology to the management and analysis of biological data. Here computers are used to gather, store, analyze and merge 
				biological data.
                It is an emerging interdisciplinary research area and is increasingly being used to improve the quality of life. The ultimate goal of
				bioinformatics is to uncover the wealth of biological information hidden in the mass of sequence, structure, literature and other 
				biological data and obtains a clearer insight into the fundamental biology of organisms and to use this information to enhance the
				standard of life for mankind. The career prospects in the field have been steadily increasing with more and more use of information
				technology in the field of molecular biology. Job prospects are in all sectors of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences,
				in research institutions, hospital and industry.
