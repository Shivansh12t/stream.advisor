				Petroleum and Petroleum products are valuable for any country. Shortage of petroleum could make Industries, automobiles and households
				come to a standstill. Petroleum engineers search the world for reservoirs containing oil or natural gas. In other words, Petroleum 
				engineers are involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas and also in each stage of oil field evaluation, development
				and production. 
				<br><br>
				The petroleum industry is broadly divided into two major sectors – the upstream sector and the downstream sector. Work in the upstream 
				sector consists of the exploration, production and exploitation of oil and natural gas. The downstream sector comprises the refining, 
				marketing and distributing functions. Petroleum Engineers function within the upstream sector & Petroleum Engineering is involved in the
				exploration and production activities of petroleum as the upstream end of the energy sector.
