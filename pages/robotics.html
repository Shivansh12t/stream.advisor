				Robots are machines that are devised to replace human beings. They are also employed in jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to
				be suitable for humans. Some of the robots function, manually while others function on remote control. Robotics is a rapidly growing field
				that has applications in diverse industries. Robotics is a field of engineering concerned with the development and application of robots,
				and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback and information processing. In other words, Robotics is all about designing robots,
				maintaining them, developing new applications and conducting research. Robotics is an exciting area of computer-controlled technology.
				<br><br>
				Robotics engineers are basically concerned with the science of robotics that is the science of flexible automation. Robotics engineers 
				design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robots.
