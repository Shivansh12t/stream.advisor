				will be produced, how they will be produced, and how they will be distributed among the members of society. Those who specialise

				pricing of products, economic forecasts, and the effect of government policies on business. Economists also help in solving problems
				like unfair wages, rapid population growth, and people migration to city centres, high crime incidence, and loss of human resources due
