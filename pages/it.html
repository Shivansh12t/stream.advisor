				Whether you're finding a new restaurant using a mobile application or updating your status on your favourite socialmedia site, computing 
				technology has become engrained in our lives. You can see then how understanding this technology and the systems on which it runs could 
				be valuable. If you like working with computers and want to learn more about software and hardware, a career in information technology (IT) 
				could be right for you. IT gives you the chance to design, develop and manage the complex computer-based information systems our world 
				depends on. 
				<br><br>
				India's IT industry is quite robust and continues to see growth. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IEBF), the industry is 
				on pace to be worth US$225 billion by the year 2020. IT has been a strong contributor to the country's socio-economic prosperity, and is 
				expected to add 230,000 new jobs in 2012 alone. Much of the IT industry in India is active in the business process outsourcing sector.
				IEBF states that foreign companies prefer to outsource their IT needs to India due to its combination of skilled workers and competitive
				costs. India's biggest IT companies include Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies, and some of the country's major
				technology hubs are Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, which is widely known as "The Silicon Valley of India."
