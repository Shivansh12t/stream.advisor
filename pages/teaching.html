				Teaching is a highly noble profession; most suited one especially for women. Teachers are always a boon to society. Through their 
				intelligence, patience and wisdom, they attempt to not only hone the learner's intellect and aptitude but also, create a well-rounded
				personality. As this field is so vast having areas of specialisations, different skills and type of training are required for different
                levels. Areas of specialisation include teaching at nursery schools, middle schools, high schools, colleges, universities, institutes,
				special schools etc. Each level calls for a different expertise.
