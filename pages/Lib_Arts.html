				Ever wondered what it would be like to study one of the oldest subjects in the world? ‘Liberal arts’ is one such subject – it goes
				back to the Ancient Greeks who considered a liberal arts education to be the ultimate mark of an educated person. A typical liberal 
				arts degree program is interdisciplinary, covering topics within the humanities, as well as social, natural and formal sciences. There
				are differences in the particular subjects included in liberal arts degree programs at different institutions.
				<br><br>
				However, the liberal arts spectrum is generally accepted as covering the following fields:
                <br><br>
				Humanities – includes art, literature, linguistics, philosophy, religion, ethics, modern foreign languages, music, theater, speech,
				classical languages (Latin/Greek) etc.
				<br><br>
				Social sciences – includes history, psychology, law, sociology, politics, gender studies, anthropology, economics, geography, business
				informatics, etc.
				<br><br>
				Natural sciences – includes astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, botany, archaeology, zoology, geology, Earth sciences, etc.
                <br><br>
				Formal sciences – includes mathematics, logic, statistics, etc. The term ‘liberal arts education’ can also be applied to the
                dedicated study of just one of the above subjects (for example, a student studying a BA in Philosophy could be said to be undertaking
				a liberal  arts education). In general, however, the term refers to degree programs that aim to provide a broader spectrum of knowledge
				and skills.
				<br><br>
				A strength and attraction of Liberal Arts are the many options it provides for students to organize a study program that is both
                personally interesting and professionally relevant. Moreover, such a major sharpens awareness of art, history, philosophy, and 
				technology and the impact of these disciplines on contemporary issues. In doing so, Liberal Studies increases students’ abilities
				to think and to communicate clearly.<br>
